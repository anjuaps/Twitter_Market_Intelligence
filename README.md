# Twitter Market Intelligence
This project was developed as a practical exercise to demonstrate system design and data engineering skills under real world technical constraints.

This project implements a real time market intelligence system that collects and analyzes Indian stock market discussions from Twitter/X. The system focuses on popular Indian market hashtags such as #nifty50, #sensex, #banknifty and #intraday which are widely used by retail traders and market participants.

Due to the unavailability of free Twitter APIs, the system uses Selenium browser automation to scrape publicly available tweets. The collected textual data is cleaned, normalized and converted into numeriacal vectors that can be used for market sentiment analysis and algorithmic trading research.

The goal of this project is not to predict markets but to demonstrate robust system design, efficient data handling and practical problem-solving under real world constraints.
